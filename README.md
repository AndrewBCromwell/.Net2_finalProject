# .Net2_finalProject
The final project for my .net2 class at Kirkwood Community  College.

This project uses a TSQL database, XAML user interfaces, n-tier architecture, and unit tests. It is for the members of a circus that visits venues across the United States.
It allows a user with the role of tour planer to view information regarding when venues were visited previously and what the average revenue per day was on those visits, add a visit to a venue to the schedule, and record the number of tickets sold and revenue brought in on any particular day.

It allows a user with the role of add planer to look at information about ad companies and previous ad campaigns, create a new ad campaign, and specify the ad items of a campaign, such as whether it was on tv, radio, or a billboard, what act of the circus the ad focused explicitly on if any, and how much they each cost. It also allows this user to link a specific venue use to an ad campaign.

If a user with the role of performer logs in, all they are allowed to do is look at the schedule of venue visits
