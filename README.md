# .Net2_finalProject
The final project for my .net2 class at Kirkwood Community  College.

This project uses a TSQL database, XAML user interfaces, n-teir architecture, and unit tests. It is for the members of a circus the visits venues accros the United States. 

It allows a user with the roll of tour planer to view information regarding when venues were visited previously and what the average revenue per day was on those visits, add a visit to a venue to the schedual, and record the number of tickits sold and revenue brought in on any particular day.

It allows a user with the roll of add planer to look at information about ad companies and previous ad campaigns, create a new ad campaigns, and specifing the ad items of a campaign, such as wrather it was on tv, radio, or a billboard, what act of the circus the ad specificaly focused on if any, and how much they each cost. It also allows this user link a specific venue use to an ad campaign.

If a user with the role of performer logs in, all they are alowed to do is look at the schedual of venue visits.
